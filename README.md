Basics of Docker
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)


Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers are isolated environments that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations, allowing the application to run consistently across different environments.

Main features of Docker:

1. Containerization: Docker uses containerization technology to create containers, which are lightweight and isolated runtime environments. Each container runs as an independent process, making it easy to deploy and manage applications without worrying about conflicts between dependencies.

2. Portability: Docker containers are highly portable and can run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This portability ensures consistency and eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem.

3. Efficiency: Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them more resource-efficient than traditional virtual machines. They start quickly, use fewer resources, and allow for denser deployment of applications on a single host.

4. Image-based deployment: Docker uses images to package applications, libraries, and dependencies, providing a consistent environment for running applications. Docker images can be versioned, shared, and reused across different stages of development, testing, and production.

5. Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple instances of containers across different hosts. Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are popular tools used for container orchestration, allowing seamless scaling and load balancing of containerized applications.

6. Versioning and Rollback: Docker images can be versioned, enabling developers to roll back to previous versions of the application if needed. This facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

7. Networking: Docker provides various networking options, allowing containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Docker also supports custom network configurations for complex networking setups.

8. Security: Containers in Docker are designed to be secure by default. They use kernel-level namespaces and control groups to isolate processes and resources, reducing the risk of one container affecting others on the same host.

9. Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a public registry that allows users to share and discover container images. It provides a vast repository of pre-built images, including official images for popular applications and base images for various programming languages and frameworks.
